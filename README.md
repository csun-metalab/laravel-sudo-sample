## Laravel Sudo Sample Application

This application exists to provide sample usage for the [csun-metalab/laravel-sudo](https://github.com/csun-metalab/laravel-sudo) Composer package.

It also leverages the [csun-metalab/laravel-directory-authentication](https://github.com/csun-metalab/laravel-directory-authentication) package to demonstrate the integration between the two packages.

One of the main features of this example application is the complete customization of the `sudo.blade.php` view. It has been templatized to fit in with the theme of the rest of the application to demonstrate the ease of making it conform to your own look-and-feel.
